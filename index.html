<b><h3><u><p style="color:DarkCyan">Artificial Intelligence (AI):</p></u></h3></b> <p> is the study of agents that exist in an environment and perceive and act
Humankind has given itself the scientific name homo sapiens—man the wise—because our mental capacities are so important to our everyday lives and our sense of self. The field of artificial intelligence, or AI, attempts to understand intelligent entities. Thus, one reason to study it is to learn more about ourselves. But unlike philosophy and psychology, which are also concerned with intelligence, AI strives to build intelligent entities as well as understand them. Another reason to study AI is that these constructed intelligent entities are interesting and useful in their own right. AI has produced many significant and impressive products even at this early stage in its development. Although no one can predict the future in detail, it is clear that computers with human-level intelligence (or better) would have a huge impact on our everyday lives and on the future course of civilization. AI is one of the newest disciplines. It was formally initiated in 1956, when the name
was coined, although at that point work had been under way for about five years. Along with modern genetics, it is regularly cited as the "field I would most like to be in" by scientists in other disciplines. A student in physics might reasonably feel that all the good ideas have already been
taken by Galileo, Newton, Einstein, and the rest, and that it takes many years of study before on can contribute new idea .</p>

<b><h3><u><p style="color:DarkCyan">What is Artificial Intelligence?</p></u></h3></b>
According to the father of Artificial Intelligence John McCarthy, it is “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.
Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think..
AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of
developing intelligent software and system
Philosophy of AI
While exploiting the power of the computer systems, the curiosity of human, lead him to wonder, "Can a machine think and behave like humans do" Thus, the development of AI started with the intention of creating similar intelligence in machines that we find and regard high in humans

<b><h3><u><p style="color:DarkCyan">What is AI Technique?</p></u></h3></b>
In the real world, the knowledge has some unwelcome properties:-  
<ol>
<li>Its volume is huge, next to unimaginable.</li>
<li>It is not well-organized or well-formatted.</li>
<li>It keeps changing constantly.</li>
<li>AI Technique is a manner to organize and use the knowledge efficiently in such a way that:  It should be perceivable by the people who provide it</li>
<li> It should be easily modifiable to correct errors</li>
<li>It should be useful in many situations though it is incomplete or inaccurate</li>
<li>AI techniques elevate the speed of execution of the complex program it is equipped with.</li>
</ol>

<b><h3><u><p style="color:DarkCyan">Rationality</p></u></h3></b>
Rationality is nothing but status of being reasonable, sensible, and having good sense of judgment.
Rationality is concerned with expected actions and results depending upon what the agent has perceived. Performing actions with the aim of obtaining useful information is an important part of rationality.
What is Ideal Rational Agent?
An ideal rational agent is the one, which is capable of doing expected actions to maximize its performance measure, on the basis of:-
<ul>
  <li>Its percept sequence</li>
  <li>Its built-in knowledge base</li>
</ul>
Rationality of an agent depends on the following:-
<ol>
  <li>The performance measures, which determine the degree of success</li>
  <li>Agent’s Percept Sequence till now</li>
  <li>The agent’s prior knowledge about the environment</li>
  <li>The actions that the agent can carry out</li>
</ol>
<b><h3><u><p style="color:DarkCyan">What Contributes to AI?</p></u></h3></b>

Artificial intelligence is a science and technology based on disciplines such as Computer
Science, Biology, Psychology, Linguistics, Mathematics, and Engineering. A major thrust of AI
is in the development of computer functions associated with human intelligence, such as
reasoning, learning, and problem solving.
Out of the following areas, one or multiple areas can contribute to build an intelligent system.

<b><h3><u><p style="color:DarkCyan">Artificial Intelligence applications</p></u></h3></b>
artificial intelligence is very much involved in the work and development of the robot that humans currently depend on in many industries and human needs. I will mention some of the applications that robots make in human lives….
Applications of Robotics:
The robotics has been instrumental in the various domains such as: 
<ol> 
<p><b><li>Industries:</b> Robots are used for handling material, cutting, welding, color coating, drilling, polishing.</p></li>
<p><b><li>Military:</b> Autonomous robots can reach inaccessible and hazardous zones during war A robot named Daksh, developed by Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), is in function to destroy life-threatening objects safely.</li></p>
<p><b><li>Medicine:</b> The robots are capable of carrying out hundreds of clinical tests simultaneously, rehabilitating permanently disabled people, and performing complex surgeries such as brain tumors.</li></p>
<p><b><li>Exploration:</b> The robot rock climbers used for space exploration, underwater drones used for ocean exploration are to name a few.</p>
</ol>
